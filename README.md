This code enables you change your mySQL host password.

You should know your old password.


These are MySQL queries written in Python, using mysqlconnector.

If you don't have mysqlconnector already installed, this will help you do that. You need an internet connection to download the mysqlconnector.

BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE: edit the old password, and new password to your desired choice.

When you start running the code, the first line will require about 10 minutes to run, so that it will determine whether you have the mysqlconnector or download it for you. NOTE: It will look like it's doing nothing,for a while.

After which, it will run the rest of the codes to change your password.

That's all.

Need further help, please let me know.
